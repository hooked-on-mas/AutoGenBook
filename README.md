# AutoGenBook
AutoGenBook is a Python-based tool that automatically generates books using LLMs. It creates chapters, sections, and subsections recursively based on user-defined content and outputs the final book as a PDF using LaTeX.

### Getting and Setting Up the OpenAI API Key

This tool requires an OpenAI API key. Once you obtain the API key, click on the key icon on the left-hand menu in Google Colab and register it with the name `openai_api`.

## What’s Inside AutoGenBook

While you can dive into the code for all the details, I realize that it might be a bit hard to follow, so let me explain the basic idea and workflow behind the tool.

### Overview

Since ChatGPT has limitations on how much text it can generate at once, simply asking it to “write a textbook” results in only 1-2 pages of content. To overcome this, AutoGenBook recursively breaks down the structure of a book starting from the main topic or title. It goes from chapters → sections → subsections, and so on. This approach ensures that ChatGPT can generate meaningful, self-contained book for you without hitting its output limit.

Finally, the content for each subdivided section is generated using ChatGPT, and then output as a PDF.

### Workflow

Here’s an outline of the process. I've simplified it by only showing the flow up to the creation of subsections, but the same recursive structure continues for deeper levels.

    E111 --> F111{Should it be devided?}
    E112 --> F112{Should it be devided?}
    F11 --> FF[(Content of Section 1.1)]
